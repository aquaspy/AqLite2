# AqLiteElectron
A simple Electron launcher using @133spider swf for launching AQW.


## Why?

Sadly, I know that it is against the TOS to use third party launchers. As long I like AE and AQW, I think that their game needs some of the quality of life improvments in AQLITE
For example, farming diamonds of nulgath in /join evilwarnul is very painfull if you don't want to accept Archfiend's Favor neither Dage's favor. The drops appear in the whole screen, lags a lot and makes the experience of farming a lot worse.

I also love linux, so I decided to create a native launcher for it.


## Is it safe?

Well, I will not steal any account and you can check the code and even build it youserlf. (I will post build instructions later).

While you will not have your account stealead, I can not gurantee that Artix will not ban you. As I said, it goes against the TOS. But for your information, here are Alina comments on twitter:

An artix dev said that they won't ban anyone using AqLite, but AqLite costs more to Artix, because it loads more information from servers. So, if you are using AqLite, make sure to support them even more!

## Is this the same as AqLite?

Well, my code is a bit different, but the core is the swf file, which is the same used by @133spider here in github

## Will it be cross plataform?

I will try to build it for windows, mac and linux, but I can't confirm if MAC builds will work if builded from a linux machine.

## Credits
95% of the credits are deserved to 133spider. Without his efforts, this would not be possible.
This is his repository: https://github.com/133spider/AQLite


## About 133spider past

He did create cetera bot. I did some searches, and seems like we won't update any bot anymore. Instead, he created AqLite, which includes only quality of life improvments. I am totally against botting, but I think that everyone makes mistakes and spider133 will not create or support any bot anymore.
## For Artix Enterteiment

First, thanks for supporting linux, Artix! This means a lot for me and I will make sure to keep supporting the game as I can. 

Second, I want to contribute, so if you guys want, you are allowed to use any part of my code in your official launcher if  you want to.

Third, if you want this repository to be off, create a issue to delete this repo and I will do so. I don't want to get in the way of artix in any way. On the contrary, I want to help. 

So if this project gets in the way of any kind of trouble, please come in and open an issue here at github.


## Important thing to say

Artix don't have any responsability with you as long you are using third party. Also, any bug in my launcher or 133spider launcher should be reported HERE IN GITHUB, never in artix.
