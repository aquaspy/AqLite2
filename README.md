# AqLiteElectron
A simple Electron launcher using @133spider swf for launching AQW.


## Why?

Sadly, I know that it is against the TOS to use third party launchers. As long I like AE and AQW, I think that their game needs some of the quality of life improvments in AQLITE
For example, farming diamonds of nulgath in /join evilwarnul is very painfull if you don't want to accept Archfiend's Favor neither Dage's favor. The drops appear in the whole screen, lags a lot and makes the experience of farming a lot worse.

I also love linux, so I decided to create a native launcher for it.


## Is it safe?

Well, I will not steal any account and you can check the code and even build it youserlf. (I will post build instructions later).

While you will not have your account stealead, I can not gurantee that Artix will not ban you. As I said, it goes against the TOS. But for your information, here are Alina comments on twitter:

You can also see this video for more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3STwRWuZVkU

As far I know, no one got banned for using it, but there will always be a chance to.


## Is this the same as AqLite?

Well, my code is a bit different, but the core is the swf file, which is the same used by @133spider here in github

## Will it be cross plataform?

I will try to build it for windows, mac and linux, but I can't confirm if MAC builds will work if builded from a linux machine.

## Credits
95% of the credits are deserved to 133spider. Without his efforts, this would not be possible.
This is his repository: https://github.com/133spider/AQLite

## For Artix Enterteiment

First, thanks for supporting linux, Artix! This means a lot for me and I will make sure to keep supporting the game as I can. 

Second, I want to contribute, so if you guys want, you are allowed to use any part of my code in your official launcher if  you want to.

Third, if you want this repository to be off, create a issue to delete this repo and I will do so. I don't want to get in the way of artix in any way. On the contrary, I want to help. 

So if this project gets in the way of any kind of trouble, please come in and open an issue here at github.
